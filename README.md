This is the code for 2 separate servers.  They are not meant to run in tandem, but you most certainly can if you want.

To make them work, please download the following for the respective servers:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/h/Downloadhttp221jar.htm">Java httpserver</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/">Python Flask Instructions</a></li>
</ul>

Then run them however you like.  For the Java Server you will have to type in the URL 'localhost/<port number>' where <port number> is the port number specified in the program

For the python server just run it and type 'localhost' into the URL
